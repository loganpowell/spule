 *
 * ## `registerCMD`
 *
 * Takes a Command object with some additional information
 * and returns a Command usable in a Task or as-is. This
 * also serves the additional benefit of giving the user a
 * constant to use instead of making any typos in keys
 * during use.
 *
 * ### Destructuring Behavior
 *
 * During a `sub$` registration, the keys in the Command
 * object are used to determine the signature of incoming
 * Commands. In order to reduce the amount of boilerplate
 * for Commands that only contain the `sub$` and `args` key,
 * the `args` key is
 * [pluck](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/blob/master/packages/transducers/src/xform/pluck.ts)ed
 * from the incoming Commands. This pulls the `args` value
 * out from the incoming Command objects to be used directly
 * (without the need for dstructuring).
 *
 * ### Example
 *
 * ```js
 * import { registerCMD, run$ } from "üçé"
 *
 * const cmd_pathless = {
 *   sub$: "PATHLESS",
 *   args: { static: "payload" }
 * }
 *
 * const pathless_handler = x => console.log("pathless ->", x)
 *
 * const CMD_PATHLESS = registerCMD(cmd_pathless, pathless_handler)
 *
 * run$.next(CMD_PATHLESS) // üèÉ
 * // pathless -> { static: 'payload' }
 *
 * const cmd_path = {
 *   sub$: "PATH",
 *   args: { static: "payload" },
 *   path: ["default", "path"]
 * }
 *
 * const path_handler = x => console.log("path ->", x)
 *
 * const CMD_PATH = registerCMD(cmd_path, path_handler)
 *
 * run$.next(CMD_PATH) // üèÉ
 * // path -> { args: { static: 'payload' }, path: [ 'default', 'path' ] }
 *
 * const test_pathless = {
 *   sub$: "PATHLESS",
 *   args: "üî•"
 * }
 *
 * run$.next(test_pathless) // üèÉ
 * // pathless -> "üî•"
 * // as you can see, the Command args have been plucked out
 *
 * const test_path = {
 *   sub$: "PATH",
 *   args: "üåä",
 *   path: ["new", "path"]
 * }
 *
 * run$.next(test_path) // üèÉ
 * // path -> { args: 'üåä', path: [ 'new', 'path' ] }
 * // only the sub$ entry has been removed leaving the rest
 *
 * // NOW: Let's stick these into a Task
 * let TASK_1 = [
 *   { ...CMD_PATH, path: "overwritten" },
 *   CMD_PATHLESS,
 *   { ...test_path, args: "üçù" }
 * ]
 * run$.next(TASK_1)
 * // path -> { args: { static: 'payload' }, path: 'overwritten' }
 * // pathless -> { static: 'payload' }
 * // path -> { args: 'üçù', path: [ 'new', 'path' ] }
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Command} command an object with four keys:
 *  1. `sub$` (required)
 *  2. `handler` (required)
 *  3. `args` (optional, sets default) during registration
 *  4. `source$` (optional, enables stream to feed Command)
