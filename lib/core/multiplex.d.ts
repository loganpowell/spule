 *
 * ### TL;DR:
 *
 * Handles Collections (array) of Commands ("Tasks") which
 * require _ordered_ choreography and/or have a dependency
 * on some (a)sync data produced by a user interaction.
 *
 * ### Synopsis:
 *
 * - Async `reduce` function, that passes an accumulator
 *   (`acc`) as a local state container between Command
 *   invocations.
 * - Commands are composed in-situ in userland (Ad hoc)
 * - spools a collection of Commands as a Task
 * - resolves any promises contained within a Command
 * - passes an accumulator (acc) to subsequent Commands in a
 *   Task
 *
 * ### Type checks on function signatures
 *
 * There are two valid forms for Task entries:
 * 1. a Unary function returning an array of Commands:
 *    referred to as "Subtasks"
 * 2. A Command object: dispatch to registered handlers
 *
 * ## Recognized Keys
 *
 * There are 4 recognized keys for a Command object:
 *
 * ### Primary keys
 *
 * ##### `sub$` key
 *
 * - Topic identifier: used for registering handlers hooked
 *    onto the Command stream.
 *
 * ##### `args` key
 *
 * - __primary control structure__ with three recognized
 *   forms that do different things in the context of a
 *   Task:
 * - non-function `args` (primitives, objects) send the args
 *   as-is to the Command handler
 * - nullary fns (`(0)=>` ) send the args_ as a Command to
 *   a `sub$` _stream_ of your choosing (ADVANCED: see
 *   Ad-hoc Stream Injection below)
 * - unary fns (`(1)=>`) are passed the inter-Task
 *   accumulated value, called and the resulting value is
 *   passed to registered Command handler
 * - Promises (and those returned from `(1)=>`) are resolved
 *   and their values sent to the handler
 * - new vals (Objects) are merged with accumulated object
 *   from preceding Task results(dupe keys overwritten)
 *
 * ### Promise-specific keys -> binary (as in two parameter,
 *   not boolean) functions:
 *
 * ##### `reso` key
 *
 * - (resolving) function `(2)=>` = handle resolved
 *   promises: MUST be a binary fn `(acc, resolved Promise)
 *   =>`
 *
 * ##### `erro` key
 *
 * - `(2)=>` = handle rejected promises: MUST be
 *   a binary fn `(acc, Promise rejection) =>`
 *
 * ### Subtasks:
 *
 * Subtasks are the way you compose tasks. Insert a Task and
 * the spool will unpack it in place (super -> sub
 * order preserved) A Subtask must be defined as a unary
 * function that accepts an accumulator object and returns a
 * Task, e.g.:
 *
 * #### PSEUDO
 * ```js
 * // { C: Command }
 * // ( { A: Accumulator }: Object ) => [{C},{C}]: Subtask
 * let someSubtask = ({A}) => [{C}, {C}, ({A})=>[{C},{C}], ...]
 * ```
 *
 * #### Example
 * ```js
 * // subtask example:
 * let subtask1 = acc => [
 *  { sub$: "acc"
 *  , args: { data: acc.data } },
 *  { sub$: "route"
 *  , args: { route: { href: acc.href } } }
 * ]
 *
 * // task
 * let task = [
 *  { args: { href: "https://my.io/todos" } }, // acc init
 *  { sub$: "fetch"
 *  , args: ({ href }) => fetch(href).then(r => r.json())
 *  , erro: (acc, err) => ({ sub$: "cancel", args: err })
 *  , reso: (acc, res) => ({ data: res }) },
 *  acc => subtask1(acc), // subtask reference
 *  { sub$: "FLIP" , args: "done" }
 * ]
 *
 *
 * ### Ad-hoc stream injection
 *
 * ADVANCED USE ONLY ðŸ‘½
 *
 * HURL tries to hide the stream implentation from the user
 * as much as possible, but allows you to go further down
 * the rabbit hole if so desired. You may send Commands to a
 * separate stream of your own creation during a Task by
 * using a nullary ("thunk") `(0)=>` function signature as
 * the `args` value of a Command. If this is the case, the
 * spool assumes the `sub$` key references a stream and
 * sends the return value of the thunk to that stream
 *
 * > Note: if you need to pass the accumulator to your
 * thunk, put it in a subtask, where you can
 * access/destructure the data from the acc passed into the
 * subtask function
 *
 * ```js
 * import { stream } from "@thi.ng/rstream"
 * import { map, comp } from "@thi.ng/transducers"
 *
 * // ad-hoc stream
 * let login = stream().subscribe(comp(
 *  map(x => console.log("login ->", x)),
 *  map(({ token }) => loginToMyAuth(token))
 * ))
 *
 * // subtask
 * let subtask_login = ({ token }) => [
 *  { sub$: login // <- stream
 *  , args: () => ({ token }) } // <- use acc
 * ]
 *
 * // task
 * let task = [
 *  // no sub$, just pass data
 *  { args: { href: "https://my.io/auth" } },
 *  { sub$: login , args: () => "logging in..." },
 *  { sub$: "AUTH"
 *  , args: ({ href }) => fetch(href).then(r => r.json())
 *  , erro: (acc, err) => ({ sub$: "cancel", args: err })
 *  , reso: (acc, res) => ({ token: res }) },
 *  acc => subtask_login(acc),
 *  { sub$: login , args: () => "log in success" }
 * ]
 * ```
